# Natural-Language-Processing

## Implemented the following models:
1. UnigramModel: an unsmoothed unigram model
2. SmoothedUnigramModel: a unigram model smoothed using Laplace (add-one) smoothing,
3. BigramModel: an unsmoothed bigram model,
4. SmoothedBigramModelLI: a bigram model smoothed using Linear Interpolation 


## For Sentimental Analysis following models have been implemented
5. Na√Øve Bayes
6. Logistic Regression
7. Random Forest
8. SVM
9. Perceptron
